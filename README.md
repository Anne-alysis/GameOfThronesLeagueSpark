# GameOfThronesLeagueSpark
Spark version of https://github.com/Anne-alysis/GameOfThronesLeague

Note: this will not be able to be run without modifications for your particular cluster and storage system.  This assumes the Spark job will be run remotely on a Dataproc cluster in Google Cloud (via `sh game-of-thrones-spark/etc/run.sh`) using GCS buckets for storage.  

Currently WORK IN PROGRESS.
